### Methods

<br>

In this study, the objectives were to (i) find the optimal solar PV to wind technology ratio at each existing wind project that maximizes the annual profit subject to the estimated generation, annual costs, and transmission line capacity of each project, (ii) rank existing wind projects on environmental sensitivity and estimated annual levelized-costs with co-location.  

To achieve these objectives, we (i) created an abstract non-linear optimization model to determine the optimal ratio of solar PV to wind at each wind project location that maximizes annual profit and (ii) conducted multi-criteria techno-economic analysis to understand how sites well-positioned for co-location of solar PV and wind could also benefit from additional financial incentives from being located within Department of Energy (DOE) disadvantaged communities and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) energy communities. All analyses were conducted using open-source Python and R programming environments and languages.
