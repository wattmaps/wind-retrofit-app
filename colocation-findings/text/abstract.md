## Retrofitting Existing Wind Projects with Solar PV in the U.S.

The demand for renewable energy such as wind and solar power in the United States (U.S.) is rapidly accelerating to help meet clean energy goals. However, a barrier to adding new wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) development lies in delays of constructing new transmission infrastructure. Co-location of renewable energy sites by adding solar PV to existing wind projects can reduce the need for new transmission infrastructure development while increasing profit from the project.

The study used an abstract nonlinear optimization model to find the optimal system size of solar PV to be added at each of the identified over 1,200 viable existing wind projects in the contiguous U.S. Using environmental sensitivity scores and estimated annual levelized-costs, the analysis then ranked the co-location projects to highlight sites that may benefit most from co-location.
