#### Show me the data

Check out the **Explore the Data** & **Explore the Map** page to find interactive data visualizations looking at optimal ratios of solar to wind for retrofitting exisiting wind sites within the US. Data was aquired through the NREL [National Solar Radiance Database](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/)  and simulated through the [System Advisory Model](https://sam.nrel.gov/) to generate capacity factor estimates.
